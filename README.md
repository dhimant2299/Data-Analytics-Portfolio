# Titanic 1 â€” Comprehensive Data Analytics Project

## Author: Dhimant Adhikari

### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to evaluate whether the survival rate on the Titanic was influenced by passenger class and to analyze age distribution within each class to identify vulnerable age groups. The analysis helps in determining whether age played a significant role in passengers' survival chances.

### Project Components:
- **SQL:** Utilized for efficient data extraction and management, ensuring precise retrieval of relevant data subsets for further analysis.
- **Python:** 
- **Data Processing:** Used Pandas for data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted survival rate analysis across different passenger classes and age groups.
- **Visualization:** Created visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover trends and correlations.
- **Tableau:** Developed an interactive dashboard that visually represents survival rates and age distributions across different passenger classes, allowing for easy exploration of the data.

### Key Findings:
- **Class Disparities:** Significant disparities exist in survival rates among different passenger classes. First-Class passengers had nearly three times the survival rate of Third-Class passengers, highlighting the importance of analyzing class-specific survival percentages.
- **Age Distribution:** Age significantly impacted survival chances:
- **Children:** Second-Class children had a 100% survival rate, while First-Class children had 80%, and Third-Class children had 40%.
- **Seniors:** No seniors survived in the Second and Third classes, and only 17% survived in First Class.

### Recommendations:
1. **Minimize Class Disparity:** Efforts should be made to reduce the survival rate gap between different passenger classes to ensure more equitable safety measures.
2. **Improve Emergency Accessibility:** Emergency protocols and accessibility measures should be investigated and improved to enhance survival rates across all age groups and passenger classes.
3. **Further Analysis for Ship Design:** The insights gained from this analysis should be used to guide further research and the design of ships with equitable safety provisions for all passengers, regardless of class or age.
