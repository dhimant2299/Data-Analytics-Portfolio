## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate whether the **survival rate** on the Titanic was influenced by **passenger class** and to analyze **age distribution** within each class to identify vulnerable age groups. The analysis aims to determine whether age played a significant role in passengers' survival chances.

## 🛠️ Project Components

- **SQL**: Utilized for efficient data extraction and management, ensuring precise retrieval of relevant data subsets for further analysis.
- **Python**:
  - **Data Processing**: Used **Pandas** for data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.
  - **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted survival rate analysis across different passenger classes and age groups.
  - **Visualization**: Created visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to uncover trends and correlations.
- **Tableau**: Developed an interactive dashboard that visually represents survival rates and age distributions across different passenger classes, allowing for easy exploration of the data.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Class Disparities**:
  - Significant disparities exist in survival rates among different passenger classes.
  - **First-Class** passengers had nearly **three times** the survival rate of Third-Class passengers.
  - Highlights the importance of analyzing class-specific survival percentages.

- **Age Distribution Impact**:
  - **Children**:
    - **Second-Class** children had a **100% survival rate**.
    - **First-Class** children had an **80% survival rate**.
    - **Third-Class** children had a **40% survival rate**.
  - **Seniors**:
    - No seniors survived in the **Second** and **Third** classes.
    - Only **17%** of seniors survived in **First Class**.
  - Age significantly impacted survival chances across different classes.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Minimize Class Disparity**:
   - Efforts should be made to reduce the survival rate gap between different passenger classes.
   - Implement equitable safety measures to ensure all passengers have similar survival opportunities.

2. **Improve Emergency Accessibility**:
   - Investigate and enhance emergency protocols and accessibility measures.
   - Focus on improving survival rates across all age groups and passenger classes.

3. **Guidance for Ship Design**:
   - Utilize insights from this analysis to guide further research.
   - Design ships with equitable safety provisions for all passengers, regardless of class or age.
